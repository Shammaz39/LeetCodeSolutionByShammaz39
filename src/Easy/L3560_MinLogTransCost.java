* You are given integers n, m, and k.

There are two logs of lengths n and m units, which need to be transported in three trucks where each truck can carry one log with length at most k units.

You may cut the logs into smaller pieces, where the cost of cutting a log of length x into logs of length len1 and len2 is cost = len1 * len2 such that len1 + len2 = x.

Return the minimum total cost to distribute the logs onto the trucks. If the logs don't need to be cut, the total cost is 0.


Example 1:

Input: n = 6, m = 5, k = 5

Output: 5

Explanation:

Cut the log with length 6 into logs with length 1 and 5, at a cost equal to 1 * 5 == 5. Now the three logs of length 1, 5, and 5 can fit in one truck each.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, m = 4, k = 6

Output: 0

Explanation:

The two logs can fit in the trucks already, hence we don't need to cut the logs.

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 105
1 <= n, m <= 2 * k
The input is generated such that it is always possible to transport the logs.
